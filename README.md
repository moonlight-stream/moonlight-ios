## Building
* Install Xcode from the [App Store page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* Run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios.git`
  *  If you've already clone the repo without `--recursive`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Open Moonlight.xcodeproj in Xcode
* To run on a real device, you will need to locally modify the signing options:
    * Click on "Moonlight" at the top of the left sidebar
    * Click on the "Signing & Capabilities" tab
    * Under "Targets", select "Moonlight" (for iOS/iPadOS) or "Moonlight TV" (for tvOS)
    * In the "Team" dropdown, select your name. If your name doesn't appear, you may need to sign into Xcode with your Apple account.
    * Change the "Bundle Identifier" to something different. You can add your name or some random letters to make it unique.
    * Now you can select your Apple device in the top bar as a target and click the Play button to run.
